TODO
-hypothesis model
-checks checks checks for the models
-optimize? joint learner takes ~2 h per action choice
-filter double choice in models
-implement learners' interaction with the world
-analysis: what to look at? information gain per action? data vs models. 
-'yoked' model? conditioned to kids' experience?

CHECKS:
+NORMALIZATIONS
+random model should use previous data to compute entropy gain? LOOKS LIKE YES
