TODO
-save whole gameplay! at least for theory model. check weight for random, if too big
save at least sequential entropies for zi.
-hypothesis model
-joint model
-measure EIG wrt optimal model, kids vs random, for different truncations. --DONE
-'yoked' model? conditioned to kids' experience? --DONE
-checks checks checks for the models --DONE
-optimize? joint learner takes ~2 h per action choice --DONE?
-implement learners' interaction with the world --DONE
-analysis: what to look at? information gain per action? data vs models. --DONE

CHECKS:
+NORMALIZATIONS
+random model should use previous data to compute entropy gain? LOOKS LIKE YES
