TODO
-measure EIG wrt optimal model, kids vs random, for different truncations. 
-'yoked' model? conditioned to kids' experience?
-hypothesis model
-joint model
-checks checks checks for the models
-optimize? joint learner takes ~2 h per action choice --DONE?
-implement learners' interaction with the world --DONE
-analysis: what to look at? information gain per action? data vs models. 

CHECKS:
+NORMALIZATIONS
+random model should use previous data to compute entropy gain? LOOKS LIKE YES
